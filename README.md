# Power BI Report Overview
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive analysis of E-commerce sales data. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, revenue by product category, customer acquisition cost, and customer lifetime value.

* Visualizations:
The report utilizes various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and maps, to analyze trends and patterns in the data. Users can interact with the report using slicers and drill-downs to explore specific product categories, customer segments, and time periods.

* Key Findings and Insights:
Some key findings from the report include:

    * Identifying seasonal trends in sales throughout the year.
    * Discovering the top-selling product categories and their contribution to overall revenue.
    * Analyzing customer acquisition costs and strategies for different customer segments.
    * Gaining insights into customer lifetime value and strategies for customer retention.


# Technical Skills
* Data Modeling:
 I built a well-structured data model with relationships between the Orders, Products, and Customers tables (if applicable) to facilitate data analysis.

* DAX Calculations:
 I created custom DAX measures to calculate KPIs like total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value (if applicable).

* Data Visualization:
The report utilizes a variety of visualizations, including bar charts for sales trends, pie charts for product category distribution, and maps for geographical analysis. I also employed conditional formatting and tooltips to enhance data presentation.

* Report Interactivity:
Users can interact with the report using slicers to filter data by product category, date range, or customer segment. Drill-downs allow for deeper analysis of specific products or customer groups.



# Future Works
