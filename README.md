  - Implemented data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, formatting dates, and creating calculated fields for key metrics.
  - Created interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI to visualize KPIs and actionable insights.
  - Collaborated with key stakeholders to understand the business requirements and refine data analysis approaches.
  - Presented findings and recommendations to support strategic decision-making.

**Methodology**:  
- **Data Acquisition**:  
  - Obtained the sales data in CSV format from Kaggle via the link [e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/onigbenga/ecommerce-dataset), consisting of CustomerId, CustomerName, CustomerEmail, CustomerGender, CustomerIp, ProductName, ProductPrice, CostOfGoods, ProductCategory, CustomerCountry, CustomerContinent, OrderTime, OrderDay, OrderMonth, QuantitySold, DiscountPerQuantity, SalePrice, and OrderYear.
- **Data Preparation**:  
  - Cleaned and transformed data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and identify outliers.
  - Implemented data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating aggregated metrics.
- **Data Analysis**:  
  - Utilized Power BI for data visualization, employing various chart types (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps) to analyze trends and patterns.
  - Developed custom DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value.
  - Implemented interactive features such as slicers and drill-downs for deeper data exploration and analysis.

**Tools and Technologies**:  
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel (for data preprocessing)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

**Challenges and Solutions**:
